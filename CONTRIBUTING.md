# Contributing guidelines
If you decide to contribute to this project, there's a couple of things to keep in mind.

By participating in this project, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Contributions to this repository are made through GitHub [issues](../../issues) and [pull requests](../../pulls).  
Before contributing, make sure there are no existing issues nor pull requests about the same thing.  
To report security vulnerabilities, please send an email to dragonacchilli@gmail.com instead.

Keep in mind that open-source projects here are developed in my free time,
so there are no guarantees when or if the reported thing will be fixed.

Check all of the necessary uppercase-named files in the root directory of the project before contributing.

## Issues
Issues should be used to report problems with the project (e.g. bugs).  
Try to describe the issue in a concise way, but with enough details to make it easier to track, reproduce, and eventually fix.  
If there are issue templates in the repository, use them.

Issues can be used for feature requests only if discussions aren't enabled for the repository. If they are, go there instead.

Try to look for similar issues in the repository. If you find one, don't create a new one, but instead
you can add your own information about the problem to the existing issue.

## Pull requests
Pull requests (PR-s) allow you to write your own code that may get integrated into the product.  

You should keep in mind the code you submit will be used with our existing license of the project (which usually
resides in the root directory of the project in a `LICENSE` file).  
The PR shouldn't do a lot of things at once, but rather add a single feature, fix a bug, etc.  
If you want to add multiple features or fix several bugs, try submitting all of them in separate pull requests.

If you're not sure if the feature you want to program would be good for the project, feel free to ask that in the discussions
of the project, or by creating a new issue if discussions are disabled.
